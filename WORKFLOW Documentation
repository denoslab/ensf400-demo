GITHUB WORKFLOW AND COLLABORATION
We created a new repo, downloaded the code from original project repo and added the code to our repo. We then used git branching to create branches for a more streamlined workflow.

•	master branch - stable code to be deployed
•	develop branch - development before merging to the master branch
•	<feature name> branch - individual feature development
